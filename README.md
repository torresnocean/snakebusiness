Welcome to snakebusiness!!

This is a shared repo where we can collaborate and work on code together as classmates.
If you would like to join, you may branch off of master and start tracking your files.
You will have access to our branches so you can compare your work because we all know
that python sucks and sometimes you just need help. 

So far we have 3 students:
-Huberto Torres
-Kevin Dang
-Daniel Ocean
